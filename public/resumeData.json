    "bio": "I love to knit. Not with yarn, but with the very threads of technology that propel humanity forward. Whether it be twisting machine learning with computer vision to develop advanced robots or intertwining PID algorithms with radionavigation to create UAVs, every experience was accompanied by the exhilaration of transforming a tangle of concepts into the lacework of a solution. It's a feeling that drove me to UT Austin, ready to explore the vast specializations and opportunities that lie in the field of CS while indulging myself in the hackathons and passion projects that define the UTCS experience.",
